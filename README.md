# Embedded Project Collection

Here, you can find codes for STM ARM Cortex - M4 Family or some other development kits, circuit schematics, and PCB designs.
All of the projects are very old, simple, and not full implementations - just initial developments or a POC.
So that you may not able to reproduce, see them as an example.

Consider every folder as a project and the below sub-title as its description.
If you find anything useful, do not hesitate to get more information.
